My history with mewithoutYou is rich and impactful. In my 20s I listened to Bright Eyes for company & confort in my sadness, David Bazan for honesty, and mewithoutYou for humility and perspective. It seemed like any time I felt directionless I could listen to mewithoutYou and they would re-frame my current situation and remind me of what is important.

I remember the first time I heard them. My best friend & crush had come over after school in 9th grade (2003) and brought [A-B] life over on cd. We sat across from each other and just listened, sharing the lyrics book. I wasn't into this genre yet, my favorite bands at the time were "Jars of Clay" and "Delirious?". I had a friend trying to get me into UnderOATH's first two albums. I was hooked at the end of the third song, when "Nice and Blue" goes quiet right before saying "I was once alive...". mewithoutYou has been my all-time favorite band ever since.

([A-B] life era) I remember going to my first mwY concert, in Lawrence or Kansas City, with Blindside. The rest of my friends couldn't go, I rode with some acquaintances (mosh pit friends). I remember that being just a little bit before Catch for us the Foxes came out, so we got a few songs from that album as teasers, and the crowd sang along with the songs we knew. It was a special feeling to watch the crowd chant "... and you'd better be alone" moving as one. I didn't have much money but I brought enough to purchase a brown t-shirt with aaron falling over while holding the mic stand.

I remember listening to January 1979 the first day it came out as a single. My friends and I loved it, despite it sounding different. We talked about how most of the songs on the album started quiet and ended loud

(Catch for Us the Foxes era) I remember going to see mwy at the Granada with my GF, best friend, and his GF. The ladies were both upset with us so we stood on the balcony and sulked through that show. I think Aaron had a cold, he spent a good chunk of that show with a scarf around his throat sitting on the bass cab.

I have a memory of being driven home from school by my 

(Brother, Sister era) My third concert was hands down the best show I've ever been to. My best friend and our girlfriends again, this time in Tulsa, OK. It was the era of the pre-show potlucks. My friend asked Aaron a question about some lyrics but Aaron was disinterested in answering and my friend was devastated (he has come to terms with it now, haha). My girlfriend was painting on a banner with other mwY fans. I walked up to Aaron after my friend talked to him and I asked "What can I do for you?". I was holding my acoustic guitar at the time and Aaron asked "Do you know any hymns?" I knew "Come Thou Fount" (from Sufjan's xmas album and Mars Hill's worship album) and he and I played that together with others who had instruments. We played maybe a dozen songs next to the mwY bus, in a circle with banjos, acoustic guitars, trumpets, and a didgeridoo. I didn't know the rest of the songs but I played along as best as I could and had a wonderful time. I remember sitting in the back of the room when the concert got going (high school relationships, sheesh) and thinking "I already got my show". The didgeridoo played with them on a song on stage, and Rickie (the drummer) was playing in his boxers, it was so hot. He ran off stage and out of the venue the moment the last song was complete, it must have been so hot. (Come to think of it, THAT is the reason we were at the back of the venue.)

(why can't I remember my 4th show with them?)

(Brother, Sister era, right before It's All Crazy came out) In Lawrence, at the Bottleneck, with Maps for Atlases. I went with a whole group of friends, and my best friend. I was upset, stood apart from everyone else and just yelled along to the songs at the top of my lungs. Drew lyrics on my arms. Aaron sang King Beetle by himself with his red guitar, and with lyrics that were more raw than the album. I went home with a raw throat and an easier heart. This was the first show that I asked for autographs, I was retiring my "Aaron falling" shirt so I had them sign it. (thanks!)

(It's all Crazy era) I saw them play at Cornerstone 2009. My band was playing satellite stages twice a day. I was exhausted and you know the manic highs of performing music, followed by the manic lows? That was me. I remember being eternally frustrated by the crowd member with the fox sign swaying the band to play "The Fox and the Crow" instead of "Silencer". I heard someone say that the band played "[A-B] Life" songs on satellite stages, I'm sorry I missed that. The only other band I saw at Cornerstone was David Bazan.

This begins the period of time I moved out on my own, worked part-time in retail, and had no money to attend shows. I played shows, I did covers of Messes of Men, Grape on the Vine, 

I bought the special edition CD for It's All Crazy, got the notebook/journal, and gosh, I did not like it. I wished for a return to [A-B] Life and it was not that. (I like it now, I've just bought the special edition - thanks for putting that out!)

I listened to Ten Stories once or twice through and was more dismissive than my friends. I preferred it to "It's All Crazy" by a little bit. 

When Pale Horses came out I loved it. I found it some time after it had come out and I had missed the vinyl release of it. It tied with "[A-B] Life" for some time as my favorite album. I was able to find the Special Edition vinyl set with red, green, and clear vinyl on eBay, it is one of my favorite records. I love the Appendix songs too.

My wife and I attended the [A-B] Life 15 year anniversary tour, bought a couple shirts, chatted with Mike Almquist the manager (what a cool guy).

I stayed up until midnight with my wife (the girl from my very first listen) to listen to the [Untitled] EP. The EP hit me hard, harder than the LP did. It just felt, important, the way the best mwY songs do. I ordered the Special Edition of that, and looking back on the delays now I am glad to have been a part of that story (I think it was delivered more than a year after it was pre-ordered). It wasn't the band or the manager's fault at all, they wanted it to be something special and they accomplished it in the end. Both of the albums are terrific.

mewithoutYou played with David Bazan in 2019 (I have all of his albums too) and my wife and I were able to watch them play then, in Oklahoma City.

## Favorite Songs & Lines

- A-B Life: Nice and Blue "I was once alive, when you held me". My love life was a long story of "unrequited love". 
- Catch for Us the Foxes: Carousels, "I had a well, but all the water left". After my break from Christianity out of high school, this line summed up what it felt like to lose the promises that evangelicals profess.
- Brother, Sister: Nice and Blue (pt. Two)"A life at best left half behind". There are so many good lines in this album.
- It's All Crazy: Goodbye, I!, "There's a movement in our stillness and however much we move / We're bound to stand completely still". This mirrors one of my other favorite lines in CFUTF "If they ask you for a sign of the Father you can tell them it's movement, movement, movement and repose!"
- Ten Stories: Elephant in the Dock, "But I know falsehood when I see it, and it looks like this whole world you've made"
- Pale Horses: Mexican War Streets, "It's not a person that dies, but worlds die inside us"
- Untitled EP: Existential Dread, Six Hours' Time, "Existential Dread, Six Hours' Time"
- Untitled LP: [dormouse sighs], "Fire and a flood, There's power in the blood"
