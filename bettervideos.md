# Better Videos for Instruction
###### by Brian Foster for IDD Fall 2019

### Description
If you are dissatisfied with attempts to add video to your Canvas shells for lecture, for announcements, for introductions, and more - join me for an explanation of why some videos look and sound better than others. I will answer questions! I will demonstrate in-person. We will practice each step of the production - from shooting, to trimming or editing, to uploading and posting to Canvas.

## Prep

Here are some things that I want to talk about.
- Of course I can talk about **"How To Make The Most Amazing Video"** but this is not that talk.
  - this talk is **"How to Make Good Videos *Easily*"** because if it is too much work, you won't do it.

### Shooting Video
- Put the camera between you and the brightest light source.
- The more light there is, the less grainy of an image you get, and often the better frame rate that you get.
- Contrast between the subject and the background creates a more striking effect. Movement on the screen is lovely.

### Audio
- Don't forget to take a breath! When you need to splice together several clips, you want it to feel natural, not rushed.
- Most of bad audio is "hearing the room" instead of the source. You pick up a lot of reverberations - your voice bouncing off the walls and floors and ceilings. If you want good audio - record in a closet!
- Lapel mics are wonderful, but your iPhone gets great audio too! The reason that a lapel mic works so well is because it is very close to the audio source (your mouth!) This allows it to be less sensitive to room reverb because the audio from your voice is stronger (louder)
- (Advanced) [Use VST Audio Plugins for OBS](https://streamgeeks.us/vst-audio-plugins-for-obs/)

### Production
- You can upload directly to YouTube from your phone, either [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&hl=en_US).
- Both iOS and Android have easy ways to trim your videos (The YouTube app works great!).
- [Zoom(free)](https://zoom.us) is a wonderful tool for screen capture as well as meeting with students, and I should **definitely** show it off.
- Can you post to canvas from your phone? Absolutely you can, but it is a terrible experience!!!
- The YouTube app will let you record directly from your phone, trim it, add effects, add background music, and then upload it. It will let you set it as unlisted so that it isn't publicly visible. Then, you can look at the video, click Share, then paste the link as a new link in an announcement or assignment. *I think this is the best option for us.*
- I definitely want to talk about my methods, how I set my videos up. (What are those methods, Brian?)
  - I record my in-class lecture with [OBS(free)](https://obsproject.com) for screen capture and my voice recorded with a mic. I use [Epic Pen($9)](https://epic-pen.com) with a [Wacom tablet($50)](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/one-by-wacom) to write on the screen. (Zoom does an alright job of this too)
  - I use a webcam in my office when I am doing "talk to the student" videos.
  - I just talk to the camera when I am trying to have a "conversation" with my students.

## Structure of the Talk
**Part One**
* Introduce myself and explain why I am up here talking about videos.
  * Why are videos useful? (Let us discuss)
* Why is my audience here?
  * What do *they* want to learn?
  
**Part Two**
* Talk about the stuff up there in prep.

**Part Three**
* Hands-on Practice (This might also be part of Part Two.)

## Computer Shortcuts and Protips
- F11 will make your program fullscreen. This looks wonderful for webpages.
- Crtl+ and Ctrl- will zoom a webpage larger and smaller, useful for getting people in the back to see your text!
- If your computer doesn't have audio or a webcam, host your Zoom meeting with your phone and join in with your computer so that they can see your screen but also hear and see you!
- Windows+ and Windows- will zoom the entire screen in and out.
