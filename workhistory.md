My name is Brian Foster. I have been studying, teaching, and working in the Interactive 3D field since 2013. I am passionate about this field of work because I enjoy creating something from nothing. I want to work on a project that will be remembered, the way that I remember Half-Life 2 or Dishonored. I want to create adventures like I found in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Perhaps we can work together in the future!

# Programs:

I have a significant amount of experience in the **Unity 3D** game engine. I teach many classes for it, I have created many projects using it, and I have been a part of Certiport's certification team.
When I model I use **3DS Max**. I teach my Game Graphics class **Substance Designer** and I love it. In addition to programming in **C#** I teach classes in **Swift** and **C++**. Content creation is made easier with Adobe products such as **Photoshop**, **Premiere Pro**, and **Audition**.
