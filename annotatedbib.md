### [The Art of VR Microtalks](https://gdcvault.com/play/1024882/The-Art-of-VR) - VRDC 2018

1. planning for VR - remember viewer heights may differ from yours, also seated versus standing. Remember where you are in space. Vignettes (points of interest) tell a story. Composition to draw focus of viewer. Comfort - don't make the viewer rotate their head too far (90 degrees total is comfortable).
2. mimicing real-life devices can people into empathy & understanding. Showing the normal, and then the abnormal, help connect people to the story. it's not how we're different - it's how we're the same.
3. how do you communicate an object's purpose? The way that it looks, tells the player how to use it. VR is already complex, so we need to make it as simple as possible. Reference Toddler toys for examples. Color, Shape, Size for important parts. Similar to Bop-it. Playtest constantly, with diverse people. Also watch: [Building Believable Characters in VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cztvrMIome4). Go all in on fun details & easter eggs. 
4. Number 4 and 5 are not applicable to my VR interests and focus more on AR, which has come A LONG way since 2018.

### [Building Virtual Reality for Public Safety](https://gdcvault.com/play/1026918/Building-Virtual-Reality-for-Public) - NIST

Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division. They partner with many colleges. A list of interesting design challenges for VR, AR, haptics, and more, to help first responders. Testing to reduce cognitive load.
VR Lessons Learned: they had built-in gathering of metrics. 
1. Good Game Design does not equal Good VR Design - Eye dominance does not always match your handedness.
1. High frequency detail causes problems - the Sizzle effect. it's even worse at a distance.
1. creating and optimizing low visibility environments. use a lower screen percentage for smoke *(can you do screen percentage resolution for PART of your view?)*

### [Accessibility in VR: How It Can Be Better ](https://gdcvault.com/play/1024865/Accessibility-in-VR-How-It) - Owlchemy Labs

1. they used hand controls in Job Simulator, let's talk about ways that we can include more human beings into your VR game.
1. Reduce Abstractions, make it understandable to a wide range of humans. short human mode, standing room only.
can you design for 1-handed play? sometimes there are floor-level things that are difficult to bend that far to get to. *(where is the list of accessibility accomodations?)*
1. how can you get subtitles to convey tone and intent? (if you can't figure it out well, maybe don't do it?)
They played 82 games across 4 different platforms. attempted play standing and sitting. how reliant is the game on voice-over or audio? how much bending is required?
1. we already have biases - we're ablebodied, can see, can hear, etc etc. make yourself aware of these - make the entire team aware of what it is like to have these different bodies.
1. headsets are bad with glasses. PSVR does the best job so far.
1. those who are seated cannot always rotate. look at how much reaching and bending is required.
1. Emberstone did a good job. settings for reaching with.
1. option for no controllers. Headmaster.
1. in-world subtitles are the best, in their opinion. Hypercube didn't have a single line of text in their game. Moss / Quill uses ASL to communicate with the player. Fantastic Contraption did a wonderful job.

Dev Tips!
1. use hovering to reduce bending and speech bubbles for captions. Playtest everything, all of the time.


### [Dialed Down Design: Developing VR For people with Autism](https://gdcvault.com/play/1024867/Dialed-Down-Design-Insights-from)
Considering settings to calm and settle the player. Overstimulating environment. Shows AR and Google Cardboard lenses without the cardboard.
Intensity Matters, Guide Attention, Vary thresholds, Balance realism with abstraction. What can you remove from the experience and still get your point across? Cueing. Biofeedback [(skip rizzo & PTSD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWS_0XnHc_Y). [Stuart Duncan, Autcraft Minecraft Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iclWth_VvBs) 

### [Exploring the Unsolved Challenges of VR Gaming ](https://gdcvault.com/play/1024869/Exploring-the-Unsolved-Challenges-of)
teaching someone to swim without water. How to design for this new medium. Rope pulling movement mechanic. shoulder pivot point for rifles. using context to make people use their muscles because they're "Acting". Gorn allows you to dismember opponents, and yourself. Q and A are good too.

### [Playtesting VR: Brownboxing, Spycams, and Fuzzy Rugs](https://gdcvault.com/play/1024863/Playtesting-VR-Brownboxing-Spycams-and) - Schell Games

This is an amazing talk on prototyping VR and AR. It also will give tips on playtesting and getting useful information from those playtests (don't say anything, let them struggle!)
