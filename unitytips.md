I have compiled some of the things that will help you navigate Unity.

[check out the documentation!](http://docs.unity.com)

## Things to know

### Moving around your Unity scene:
  - Right-Click and drag to look around, use WASDQE to fly around your scene.
  - MiddleMouse and drag to pan around your scene.
  - Alt+LeftClick to rotate around an object
- Materials are comprised of several images and have variables for smoothness, tiling, offset, normal maps, height, color, and more.
- Smooth Materials should have a high smoothness, rough materials should have a low smoothness.
- The color picker next to the albedo image in your material will let you tint the object.
- Shortcut Keys!
  - F to focus on an object 
  - Ctrl+D to Duplicate
  - V to snap to corners (vertices)
  - Q to pan
  - W to move or translate
  - E to rotate
  - R to scale
  - T for Rect handles
- The Inspector on the right side of the screen has a Transform component that will let you enter in the values of Position, Rotation, and Scale - this is really helpful when you want to zero out the rotation of something (reset it back to 0,0,0.)
- Prefabs! Can be useful for making changes to many things at once. Note the buttons in the Inspector: Prefab: Select, Revert, and Apply
- GameObject > 
  - Move to View (Ctrl+Alt+F)
  - Align with View (Ctrl+Shift+F)
  - Align View to Selected
  - Toggle Active State (Alt+Shift+A)

### Saving your project!

1. Unity isn't ONE FILE like a .PSD, it's a collection of files in your folder. Your scene file is important, when you hit Ctrl+S you're saving the changes you've made to your scene file, but all of your images and prefabs and animations for the flying camera are in the folders next to your scene file. 
1. Double click in the project tab and select "Show in Explorer". Move up a folder or two until you see the Assets and Project Settings folders
1. Select both folders and right click > Send to > compressed zipped folder - This is the file you need to take home. Call it "Week4 Game Graphics" or whatever you like.
1. When you get home, move the zipped folder to your desktop or documents and unzip it. Drill down to your Scene folder and (assuming you have Unity3D installed) double-click on your scene file to open it with Unity.
